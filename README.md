This is a fork of the Accessible Astro Starter theme https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter expanded with Strapi CMS REST API and CSS animations. At Dilmah and the [MJF Charitable Foundation](https://www.mjffoundation.org/disability/) we are thankful to the original contributors of the theme [markteekman Mark Teekman](https://github.com/markteekman/) and [rafagarcia](https://github.com/rafagarcia) by making the web more accessible.

Appreciation, thanks and credits goes to the open source [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/) communities. Especially to [Antony Faris](https://github.com/antonyfaris) who is a contributor to Astro and helped us with the job making the Astro Starter working with Strapi and CSS animations. For the CSS to [better-think]([https://github.com/better-think](https://github.com/better-think/teacup-animation)) for the Tea cup animation (optimized by Antony) and percentages animation by [Sergio Pedercini](https://codepen.io/sergiopedercini/pen/jmKdbj).

## Documentation
Documentation on combining Astro starter theme with Strapi is work in progress and will be linked here soon.
